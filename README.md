# CS50 AI Study Journal

Welcome to my study journal for Harvard's CS50 AI course. 

## Goals
- Gain a solid understanding of AI concepts, algorithms, and applications.
- Strengthen math fundamentals in areas like algebra, calculus, linear algebra, and probability.

## Structure
- `CS50_AI/`: Notes, reflections etc for each week of the CS50 AI course.
- `Math_Prerequisites/`: Essential math topics that support AI learning.
- `Resources/`: Additional resources for extended learning.

## Progress Tracking
- Iâ€™ll update this repository weekly with new notes, reflections and other interesting things.


## Table of Contents
- [Math Prerequisites - Logic](Math_Prerequisites/2024-11-02_Propositional_Logic.md)
