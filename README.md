- Strengthen math fundamentals in areas like algebra, calculus, linear algebra, and probability.

## Structure
- `CS50_AI/`: Notes, reflections, and exercises for each week of the CS50 AI course.
- `Math_Prerequisites/`: Essential math topics that support AI learning.
- `Resources/`: Additional resources for extended learning.

## Progress Tracking
- Iâ€™ll update this repository weekly with new notes, practice problems, and summaries.
