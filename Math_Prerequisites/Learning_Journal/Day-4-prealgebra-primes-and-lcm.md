**Some definitions :**

A **prime number** is a natural number greater than one whose e only factors are 1 and itself.

A **composite number** is a natural number which is not a prime number

A **multiple** of a no. is the product of a number and a natural number. E.g let no be 6, 6 * 1 = 6, 6 * 2 = 12 etc , here 6, 12 are multiples of 6 where 1,2 are natural numbers

In the expression  a.b, both a and b are called **factors**. If  a.b=m, and both a and b are integers, then a and b are factors of m.

Rewriting a number as a product of primes is called prime factorization of the number eg: 12 = 2 * 2 * 3


The smallest number that is a multiple of two numbers is called the **least common multiple** (LCM).

I completed Chapter 2.  I also re-solved the pre-algebra challenge on KhanAcademy. Got 4 questions wrong out of 30.


###Next Steps

Chapter 3,4,5 - Integers, Fractions and Decimels, lets cover those quickly
