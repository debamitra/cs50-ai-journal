### What I did today?

I read about natural numbers and whole numbers today. I wonder why they are treated as two different concepts when whole numbers are just natural numbers +  zero. 
Learned about place value (units place, tens place, hundreds, etc) and memorized this nifty diagram for converting number to words and back. Also learned about rounding off whole numbers.

### Next Steps..
Thinking about doing some mini projects based on these concepts. Some ideas from chatGPT, using Flask/FastAPI, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Pandas, Python -

- **Prime Number Visualization**:
  - Create a program to display prime numbers up to a given limit and highlight their distribution.
  
- **Counting Program**:
  - Build a script that takes input from a user and counts objects or occurrences of an item in text (like words in a document).

- **Data Processing for AI**:
  - Simulate a sensor data logger that generates random floating-point numbers, then preprocess the data by rounding to 2 decimal places.
  
- **Place Value Puzzle**:
  - Create a game where the user rearranges digits of a number to form the largest or smallest possible value.

- **Dataset Cleaner**:
  - Develop a script to preprocess a dataset (e.g., removing negative values, rounding floating-point numbers to consistent decimal places).

- **Digit Recognition**:
  - Build a program that generates natural numbers as input and maps them to their names ("5" â†’ "five"). 
  - Extend this using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for digit recognition with images.
