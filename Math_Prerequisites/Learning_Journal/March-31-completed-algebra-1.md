Final Topic - Representing Quadratic equations in a graph

graph of quadratic equations in 2 variables is a parabola ->  $y = ax^2+bx+c$

**What is the axis of symmetry?** The vertical line passing through the middle of the parabola 

**What is the vertex ?** The higest or lowest point in the parabola. Formula ->  $\frac{-b}{2a}$


Quadratic formula -> $\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$


```
Discriminant 
               >  0 -> two solutions

               =  0 -> 1 solution
               
               <  0 -> no solution
```
