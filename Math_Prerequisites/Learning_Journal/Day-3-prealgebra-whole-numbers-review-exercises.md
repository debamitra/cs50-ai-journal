### What I did today?

I wanted to go through more stuff today afternoon but fell asleep.I picked things back up in the late evening, did math for about an hour from 8-9 with some small breaks inbetween. I felt bored initially and struggled with this feeling and not wanting to start. Then I just ignored it(reframing to stop focusing on the emotion and focus on taking action). I grabbed a pen and some paper, opened the book and narrowed my focus to the first line, then the next and so on. Life's tough ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Reviewing concepts like numbers and the properties of the operations like division property of 0 (e.g 0 divided by any number in 0, or a number divided by 0 is undefined) feels useful because when we think about inputs,data types and edge cases in programming, we need to think of all this specially when dealing with mathematical processing.

So...whole Numbers, reviewed key concepts and did the Practice test. Chapter 1 complete.

### Next Steps..

Move to Chapter-2, The Language of Algebra. To move faster, lets work backwards this time. Skip to the Review concepts and terms section and practice test, only go back and read the parts in the chapter I want more clarity on.
