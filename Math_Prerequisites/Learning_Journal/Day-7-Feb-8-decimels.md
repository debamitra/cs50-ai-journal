Read through Decimals chapter today.

I was reading about the circle and its properties and was thinking -  the area and perimeter of a circle can never be an exact numerical value but an approximation only. Because π is irrational and can't be represented exactly numerically but only as an approximation like 3.14. Only way to represent these values exactly will be in terms of π itself. Like e.g, 
if radius is 10cm , Area = 100π cm2 (exact)
Area = 100 * 3.1416 = 314.16cm2 (approx)
