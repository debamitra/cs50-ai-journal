Did 15 mins of math today. Read through the Introduction to integers portion in Openstax prealgebra book and did one unit of khanacademy. Integers are counting/natural numbers + zero + opposites (negatives). e.g opposite of 2 is -2, 3 is -3 etc

I like doing math right before sleeping but maybe waking up early morning and doing math might be cool. Would like to try sometime.

For now lets focus on daily math!

Cheers
