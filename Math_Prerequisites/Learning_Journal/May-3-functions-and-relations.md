### Relations and Functions

A **relation** is just x,y pairs (a set of ordered pairs). Any kind -  {(1,2),(2,1),(1,1) }

- binary relation -> between pairs of elements 

- unary relation -> on a single set

- ternary relations -> between triples of elements




A **function** is a pair of x,y's where for one x there is only one y. Multiple y's may map to same x. No worries


**Domain** - all x values of the function/relation

**Range** - all y values of the funtion/relation


Functions provide reliable ways to model real world. One input -> one output always.

Predictable, Mathematically sound, ideal for real world modeling

**Function compositions** -
If I want to compose two functions f: A → B and g: B → C, the co-domain of f must match the domain of g. Even if f’s actual range is smaller, the composition is only valid if g can accept all of f’s co-domain.


#### Questions?
1. What is a co-domain? co-domain vs range?
   
   the output space (co-domain). all actual outputs(range)
   
2. What is the need to have a co-domain and not just have a range?
   
   I am thinking of it wrong. We just define functions that way - ie. in formal math, we define a function in 3 parts, its domain, co-domain and the rule that maps elements of the domain to elements of the co-domain. So by definition it will have a domain which is all possible x inputs and co-domain which is all possible y outputs. Its an invalid function if we have an output value which is not present in the co-domain. If co-domain = range, its a function property and defines a certain kind of function called surjective (onto) function. It is also relevant when defining function compositions.

   The main reason we define a co-domain (even though the range could seem sufficient) is that it helps us reason about function properties independent of their actual output e.g. to study whether a function is surjective or not, or to construct valid compositions.
