### Relations and Functions

A **relation** is just x,y pairs (a set of ordered pairs). Any kind -  {(1,2),(2,1),(1,1) }

- binary relation -> between pairs of elements 

- unary relation -> on a single set

- ternary relations -> between triples of elements




A **function** is a pair of x,y's where for one x there is only one y. Multiple y's may map to same x. No worries


**Domain** - all x values of the function/relation

**Range** - all y values of the funtion/relation


Functions provide reliable ways to model real world. One input -> one output always.

Predictable, Mathematically sound, ideal for real world modeling

#### Questions?
1. What is a co-domain? co-domain vs range?
   the output space (co-domain). all actual outputs(range)
